-- Here is a simple proof of transitivity. Also, this is a comment~

-- Every proof starts with the keyword "Proof."
Proof.

-- Next, we list the steps of our proof. You can use any order of
-- numbers that you want, but make sure there are no duplicates.

1. a => b [Assumption]
2. b => c [Assumption]
3. a [Assumption]
4. b [ImpliesElim 3 1]
5. c [ImpliesElim 4 2]

-- The last statement in a proof is taken as the conclusion by default.
6. a => c [ImpliesIntro 5]

-- Our proof is complete~
