Propcheck (version 0.0.1)
  -- copyright 2017 by Ben Selfridge

PropCheck is a program that automatically checks a proof you write in
intuituionistic propositional logic. The program consists of a single
executable called "check". To use it, write a proof in a file called
myProof.pf (or whatever extension you like", and run the following
command:

  > check myProof.pf

The output will be a single line of the form

  [<assumptions>] |- <conclusion>

or some kind of error message. <conclusion> is (by default) the
conclusion of the final step in your proof, and <assumptions> are the
list of assumptions your proof did not discharge.

Run "check --help" for a list of other options.
